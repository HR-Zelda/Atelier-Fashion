# Screenshots & Details

1. Product Overview
   <details>
     <summary>Written Details</summary>
     <p>The Product Overview section displays product information, available styles, and an image gallery for the selected product. Users may select a particular style by clicking on its circular thumbnail image, and view additional images of this style by clicking through the image carousel on the left side of the main image (lefthand side image carousel is not displayed on smaller device widths) or using the forward and back arrows to either side of the main image. Users may also scroll directly to an image of the selected style by clicking on its anchor, which will be either an icon or thumbnail depending on device width. Clicking on the main image will expand the main image and clicking on the expanded image will zoom the image 2.5 times and allow the user to pan the zoom image on hover. Clicking the main image again will exit the enlarged view.</p>

  </details>
   <br> The Related Products section displays an image carousel of products related to the currently selected product. The number of carousel items visible at once changes dynamically depending on the view width. Uers can navigate through any additional related items by clicking the arrows on the right and left side of the carousel. The carousel will scroll through all the visible items, and display all items that were previously not visible, unless there are no more list items in the scroll direction, in which case, the carousel will scroll until it reaches the item at the end of list in the scroll direction. The arrows are not visible if the last item in either direction is already showing. Clicking on a related item card redirects to that product's page. Users can create an outfit list by adding/removing products they might be interested in.
   The user can compare details of the currently selected product and a related product by clicking the star button in the upper righthand corner of a related item card. Clicking the "X" button in the upper righthand corner of an outfit list card removes that product from the user's outfit list.
